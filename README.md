Multi-User Home Budget Tool

# About
Budgeteer is a small webtool for your household, so everyone can see
who paid what in the last few days/weeks/months. Budgeteer is intended
as a Webtool, so data is easily shared between devices.

Yep.

## This project ist pretty slow! Why aren't you using Library/Tool XYZ to speed up the development?
Using Libraries often increases the complexity in projects too much.
This project is intended to be as lean and fast as possible. A simple tool like this should not require mulitple Megabytes.
